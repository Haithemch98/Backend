# TheFreelencerSite,
for the process chat 
the createConversation in the controller conversation is for creating like a room between 2 users 
the getSingleConversation is for verifying after in the front if that user have a room with that other user if he don't have we will create a new room 

Now for the message controller :
the sendMessage is for sending message for a specific user in a specific conversation to a specifc user 
the getMessages is to get all the messages between 2 users
